          Tuesday, June 17, 1997
          <p> </p>

          “This was the hardest one yet. We came so close to another catastrophe. I have to be able to disassemble it faster. Every second I take puts me and everyone at risk. I have to get faster and sharper. My execution will be beautiful.”

          <p> </p>

          Friday, June 20, 1997
          <p> </p>

          “Today was a beautiful day. Everything went according to plan and now I am just resting at your favourite coffee shop. The birds are chirping, the sun is bright and warm as fire. I even ordered your favourite coffee. Wish you were here with me.”
          <p> </p>
          Saturday, June 21, 1997
          <p> </p>

          “God is unjust. Why did you have to go? It was my fault. I should have been better, I let you go when I told you to cut the cord. I should have listened to you. I’m sorry. Please bring her back. If only I had another chance. If only I could go back to that day when we last saw each other. The last moment that I heard your voice. I would have chose otherwise. I could have kept you here with me. I’m sorry my beautiful Esther.”
          <p> </p>
          Wednesday, June 25, 1997
          <p> </p>

          “I couldn’t go to work today. Not yet. I hesitate too much, I think too much. I wouldn’t be any use to the team. I need time. Time to figure out what happened, what’s next, what's beautiful. I need time.”
          <p> </p>
          Monday, September 15, 1997
          <p> </p>

          “I will make it up to you. I will avenge you. I won’t let them win anymore. I’m sorry Esther. I’m coming for you. I will see you soon. Hopefully I can make things right and see you again someday on beautiful terms.”
