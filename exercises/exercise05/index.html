      <div id="One"> Kokiden and the other great ladies were still relentless, and </div>
      <div id="Two">  went about saying 'it looked as though the Emperor would be no </div>
      <div id="Three"> less foolishly obsessed by her memory than he had been by her </div>
      <div id="Four"> person.' He did indeed sometimes see Kokiden's son, the first- </div>
      <div id="Five"> born prince. But this only made him long the more to see the </div>
      <div id="Six">  dead lady's child, and he was always sending trusted servants, </div>
      <div id="Seven"> such as his own old nurse, to report to him upon the boy's </div>
      <div id="Eight"> progress. The time of the autumn equinox had come. Already the </div>
      <div id="Nine"> touch of the evening air was cold upon the skin. So many </div>
      <div id="Ten"> memories crowded upon him that he sent a girl, the daughter of </div>
      <div id="Eleven">his quiver-bearer, with a letter to the dead lady's house. </div>
      <div id="Twelve"> It was beautiful moonlit weather, and after he had dispatched the </div>
      <div id="Thirteen"> messenger he lingered for a while gazing out into the night. It was </div>
      <div id="Fourteen"> at such time as this that he had been wont to call for music. He </div>
      <div id="Fifthteen"> remembered how her words, lightly whispered, had blended with </div>
      <div id="Sixteen"> those strangely fashioned harmonies, remembered how all was </div>
      <div id="Seventeen"> strange, her face, her air, her form. He thought of the poem which </div>
      <div id="Eighteen"> says that 'real things in the darkness seem no realer than dreams,' </div>
      <div id="Nineteen"> and he longed for even so dim a substance as the dream-life of </div>
      <div id="Twenty"> those nights. </div>
